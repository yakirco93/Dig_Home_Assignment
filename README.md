Answers to questions:
1.	I didn't encounter any problems working with the data.
2.	The main problem with the address column is that the values don't appear in the same order on each row, making it challenging to write a function that finds an address pattern.
But it is possible to write a function that accepts several types of values. 
First of all, we will divide the data according to the structures it appears, that is, according to the order of the values, we will manually check what is valid and what is not a real address. 
Then we will write a function that will receive a specific template. For example, a string, comma, number and an upper-case string.
